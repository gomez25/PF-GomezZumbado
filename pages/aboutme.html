            <p>
                I am a Systems Engineer with over 5 years of experience
                in the development and implementation of WCF, Web APIs, .NET Core, and
                Blazor. Throughout my career, I have demonstrated a strong passion for
                programming and databases, and I am committed to continuously
                expanding my knowledge and expertise in these areas.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                Having completed several courses, including "Unit Testing .Net with
                XUnit and MOQ," "C# Basics for Beginners: Learn C# Fundamentals," and
                "C# Intermediate: Classes, Interfaces and OOP," I possess a solid
                foundation in C# programming. These courses have equipped me with the
                necessary skills to develop robust and scalable applications.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                Furthermore, the course "C# Advanced Topics: Prepare for Technical
                Interviews" has sharpened my problem-solving abilities and prepared me
                for technical interviews, allowing me to tackle complex programming
                challenges with confidence.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                I have also acquired proficiency in dependency injection in .NET Core
                and .NET 6, enabling me to design and develop highly maintainable and
                modular software solutions. Additionally, my knowledge of Entity
                Framework Core .NET 5 allows me to efficiently work with databases and
                manage data access.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                To ensure the delivery of clean and efficient code, I have extensively
                studied SOLID principles and clean coding practices through the "SOLID
                and Clean Code" course. This knowledge helps me create software
                solutions that are easy to understand, maintain, and extend.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                Moreover, I have gained advanced knowledge in SQL Server and database
                administration through the "SQL Server Advanced" course offered by
                Globant University. This expertise allows me to design and optimize
                database structures, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                In addition to technical skills, I have developed effective
                communication and leadership abilities through the "Communication:
                Lead Fundamentals" course. These skills enable me to collaborate
                seamlessly with cross-functional teams and lead projects effectively.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                I have also pursued professional development in other areas, such as
                language proficiency, holding an EFSET B2 Upper Intermediate
                certification in English. This proficiency allows me to effectively
                communicate and collaborate in an international work environment.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                Furthermore, I have expanded my skill set to include expertise in
                RabbitMQ, a widely-used message broker that facilitates reliable and
                scalable communication between systems.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                Additionally, I have experience in implementing Continuous Integration
                and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, ensuring a streamlined
                and automated software delivery process.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                With a strong foundation in programming, databases, and a continuous
                desire to learn and improve, I am dedicated to delivering high-quality
                solutions and driving innovation in the field of software engineering.
                I am excited to take on new challenges and contribute to the success
                of projects and organizations I work with.
